# My Portofolio


## Classification
### 1. [Categorical Peoples Interests](https://github.com/benyamindariadi/machine-learning/tree/master/clustering-categorical-peoples-interests)
- **Context:** There are 4 groups/classes of people and 217 hobby's and interest questions
- **Project:** Predict the person's class based on their interests.
- **Algorithms:** Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Artificial Neural Networks.
- **Dataset:** [Source.](https://www.kaggle.com/rainbowgirl/clustering-categorical-peoples-interests)

### 2. [Mushroom Classification](https://github.com/benyamindariadi/machine-learning/tree/master/mushroom-classification)
- **Context:** This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be'' for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
- **Project:** Predict whether the mushroom is poisonous or not.
- **Algorithms:** Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine.
- **Dataset:** [Source.](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification)

### 3. [Fake Job Description Prediction](https://github.com/benyamindariadi/machine-learning/tree/master/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction)
- **Context:** The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent.
- **Project:** Predict whether the job posting is real or not
- **Algorithms:** Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks.
- **Dataset:** [Source.](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction)

### 4. [Twitter User Gender Classification](https://github.com/benyamindariadi/machine-learning/tree/master/twitter-user-gender-classification)
- **Context:** This data set was used to train a CrowdFlower AI gender predictor. You can read all about the project here. Contributors were asked to simply view a Twitter profile and judge whether the user was a male, a female, or a brand (non-individual). The dataset contains 20,000 rows, each with a user name, a random tweet, account profile and image, location, and even link and sidebar color.
- **Project:** Predict twitter user's gender
- **Algorithms:** Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine.
- **Dataset:** [Source.](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-user-gender-classification)
- **Note:** In this project I neglect the text column, please look at [Text](#text) section my model based on user's tweets and profile descriptions

### 5. [Online Shoppers Intention](https://github.com/benyamindariadi/machine-learning/tree/master/online-shoppers-intention)
- **Context:** The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions. The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.
- **Project:** Predict whether the customer will generate revenue or not
- **Algorithms:** Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks.
- **Dataset:** [Source.](https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/online-shoppers-intention)
